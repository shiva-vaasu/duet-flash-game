# duet-flash-game

An interactive, fast-paced arcade game developed as part of a college project. The game challenges players to synchronize the movement of two orbiting orbs to navigate through a series of increasingly difficult obstacles.

 * Objective: Navigate through falling hurdles without letting either ball make contact.
   
 * Controls: * Left Arrow / A: Rotate the orbs counter-clockwise.
   * Right Arrow / D: Rotate the orbs clockwise.
     
🚀 Features
 * Dynamic Obstacles: Hurdles with varying shapes and rotation patterns.
 * Fluid Physics: Smooth orbital movement and collision detection.
 * Increasing Difficulty: Level progression with faster speeds and tighter gaps.
 * Clean Minimalist UI: Focused gameplay with no distractions.
